In this manuscript, we apply a Symbiodiniaceae-specific Hidden Markov Model of the ITS2-proximal stem for the identification and verification of ITS2 sequences. This structure-based annotation facilitates the retrieval of correct ITS2 from poorly annotated GenBank sequences, reducing sequence redundancy while preserving robust diversity of ITS2 in current reference databases. Our recompiled database provides a badly needed reference catalog and resource tool to the coral reef research community for precise and unanimous species resolution among Symbiodiniaceae.
